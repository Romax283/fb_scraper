March 15, 22, 29 and April 5, 12, 19 and 26!!!\\nWhen: From 6:45 to 8:30pm\\nWhere: JFK Junior High School in Northampton, MA\\nCost: All for the ridiculously low price of $65 for non-ACA members and $50 for ACA members\\nWho: Open to all skill levels, (rolling is optional) and a wet exit can be taught.\\nRequired equipment: whitewater boat (playboats, river runners and creek boats; actual polo boats are also allowed), skirt, paddle, helmet and PFD.\\nWhat we do: Though this isn't our club, here's a look at what you can expect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLD89lyRia0\\n  \\nAll are welcome to play and the game is easy to learn.  We'll teach you to play in a relaxed atmosphere and the games are played where all can participate.  In addition to having a lot of fun, all participants improve or de-rust their boat handling skills by just participating.  It's a great workout that can push you way harder than any other type of pool session. Have no doubt that this is a good time.\\n\\nIf you are a novice boater: Many rank beginners have played in the past; if you don't have a roll and are uncomfortable with being pushed over we will recognize that. \\n\\nThe only equipment/skills that are needed to play are: a whitewater boat (playboats, river runners and creek boats), a skirt, a paddle, a helmet and a wet exit (rolling is optional).  If you don't have equipment, let us know and we'll see what we can find (no promises though).\\n\\nIf you are interested or have questions, send along an e-mail to: kayakpolowesternma@gmail.com \\n\\nHope to SYITP (see you in the pool).\\n\\nCheers ...,O-Town Kayak Polo 2013-2014,video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLD89lyRia0,2016-12-20 14:47:30,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0\", checksum=1692545773, serialized_key_size=3, serialized_value_size=1878)\n",

The USA will send a full Whitewater Slalom Team to the Rio Olympics. Rafal Smolen (Michal Smolen's Dad) & Silvan Pobraj are the Olympic coaches.   The International Canoe Federation has assigned Olympic Slots to the USA for K1W and C2. Ashley, Devin & Casey qualified the Olympic spots for the USA with their performances at international races in 2015 and qualified for the US Team at Team Trials races in Charlotte, NC & OKC this spring. Casey had already locked down an Olympic spot in C1 so he was already counted as a warm body in the US Olympic delegation. The only remaining question was what Olympic spots other countries would claim and a bit of politics and procedure to verify that the USA could send a K1W and a C2.,,status,,2016-05-20 10:54:09,15,1,1,15,0,0,0,0,0\", checksum=-1894375404, serialized_key_size=3, serialized_value_size=971)\n",

The national team coaches are concentrating on the Olympics and racing in Europe and there is no funding for it.  In a last ditch effort to keep it going, I asked the Nantahala Racing Club if they could organize it, but they declined.  So, there is no regional team training camp this year.  Apologies to anyone who went to the races thinking they could qualify for the team.  On the other hand, I am going to take a couple of kids to Charlotte to train the week before Junior Olympics at NOC, July 23-30.  So, if you are interested in going to Charlotte and paddling there that week, then going to Junior Olympics at NOC, contact me.  It is too far for us to go to Charlotte on weekends, so hot crowded summer is the best time for us to go.  Without sufficient practice at Charlotte, it is impossible to race there.

I believe that the struggles that I went through as an athlete and the successes that I have achieved both as paddler, business person, former whitewater park Board Member, and educator can help guide the USACK through the current changes in the sport.  Finally, I wish to keep building the paddling community through an athlete centric approach both logistically and financially.  \\n \\nAdam Van Grack - North Potomac, MD\\nI have been involved with the sport of Canoe Slalom in the United States for over 20 years as an athlete and sport administrator, and I am honored to be nominated for Slalom Director. I hope to be able to assist the Canoe/Kayak National Governing Body in all aspects of athlete development, athlete training, race organization, athlete/membership communication, athlete success, and financial security.

There will eventually be 6 more! When not actively being used we're keeping them on the river right shoreline. This keeps them out of the way of river runners, fishermen, and water when the level changes. They can be pulled out into the current by boat and/or by walking across the shallow eddy. If you're a local to Tville can you monitor them even if you aren't using them?

Much faster than the L'Edge, my other OC1. At first I found it long on the narrow Penrith Whitewater course, but I can pull it into some of the smaller eddies now. Plus the length makes it faster, and being lighter, it's easier to boof--it almost gets air on the Main Wave rooster tail!

This looks to be a low water year but we will hold the race regardless.  It was about 1080 cfs last year which was a nice level.  It will probably be closer to 700 cfs this year. Bob will change the course as needed, we have run the race at lower levels. If I have any spare time (ha ha) I'll try to go back and see what's the lowest we have run it at. \\nYou know you're going to have a great time no matter what the water level is so get those entries in!

March 15, 22, 29 and April 5, 12, 19 and 26!!!\\nWhen: From 6:45 to 8:30pm\\nWhere: JFK Junior High School in Northampton, MA\\nCost: All for the ridiculously low price of $65 for non-ACA members and $50 for ACA members\\nWho: Open to all skill levels, (rolling is optional) and a wet exit can be taught.\\nRequired equipment: whitewater boat (playboats, river runners and creek boats; actual polo boats are also allowed), skirt, paddle, helmet and PFD.\\nWhat we do: Though this isn't our club, here's a look at what you can expect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLD89lyRia0\\n  \\nAll are welcome to play and the game is easy to learn.  We'll teach you to play in a relaxed atmosphere and the games are played where all can participate.  In addition to having a lot of fun, all participants improve or de-rust their boat handling skills by just participating.  It's a great workout that can push you way harder than any other type of pool session. Have no doubt that this is a good time.\\n\\nIf you are a novice boater: Many rank beginners have played in the past; if you don't have a roll and are uncomfortable with being pushed over we will recognize that. \\n\\nThe only equipment/skills that are needed to play are: a whitewater boat (playboats, river runners and creek boats), a skirt, a paddle, a helmet and a wet exit (rolling is optional).  If you don't have equipment, let us know and we'll see what we can find (no promises though).\\n\\nIf you are interested or have questions, send along an e-mail to: kayakpolowesternma@gmail.com \\n\\nHope to SYITP (see you in the pool).\\n\\nCheers ...,O-Town Kayak Polo 2013-2014,video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLD89lyRia0,2016-12-20 14:47:30,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0\", checksum=-410639566, serialized_key_size=3, serialized_value_size=1878)\n",

Ashley, Devin & Casey qualified the Olympic spots for the USA with their performances at international races in 2015 and qualified for the US Team at Team Trials races in Charlotte, NC & OKC this spring. Casey had already locked down an Olympic spot in C1 so he was already counted as a warm body in the US Olympic delegation. The only remaining question was what Olympic spots other countries would claim and a bit of politics and procedure to verify that the USA could send a K1W and a C2.,,status,,2016-05-20 10:54:09,15,1,1,15,0,0,0,0,0\", checksum=-1663816718, serialized_key_size=3, serialized_value_size=971)\n",

The national team coaches are concentrating on the Olympics and racing in Europe and there is no funding for it.  In a last ditch effort to keep it going, I asked the Nantahala Racing Club if they could organize it, but they declined.  So, there is no regional team training camp this year.  Apologies to anyone who went to the races thinking they could qualify for the team.  On the other hand, I am going to take a couple of kids to Charlotte to train the week before Junior Olympics at NOC, July 23-30.  So, if you are interested in going to Charlotte and paddling there that week, then going to Junior Olympics at NOC, contact me.  It is too far for us to go to Charlotte on weekends, so hot crowded summer is the best time for us to go.  Without sufficient practice at Charlotte, it is impossible to race there.  If you are interested, contact me: rlugbill@gmail.com. - Ron Lugbill,,status,,2016-06-08 15:39:16,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0', checksum=1516143501, serialized_key_size=3, serialized_value_size=1099)\n",
